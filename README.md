## Features

- **Dynamic JSON Routes**: Provides JSON responses for various routes, including random numbers and quotes.
- **API Landing Page**: A dedicated landing page for API routes, with links and descriptions of available endpoints.
- **Random Quotes API**: Returns a quote of the day with the current date and timestamp.
- **Extensible Structure**: Easy to add more routes and functionality as needed.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **PHP 8.x**
- **Composer** (Dependency manager for PHP)
- **Symfony CLI** (Optional but recommended for easier server management)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd yourrepository
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Use Composer to install the project's dependencies:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env.local` file to set up local environment variables if needed (e.g., database credentials).

### Running the Application

To start the application, use the Symfony CLI:

```bash
symfony serve
```

If you're not using Symfony CLI, you can also use PHP’s built-in server:

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

## Available Routes

The application provides the following routes:

- `/api` - **API Landing Page**: Displays a summary of available JSON routes on this site.
- `/api/lucky/number` - **Lucky Number**: Returns a random lucky number in JSON format.
- `/api/quote` - **Quote of the Day**: Returns a random quote with the current date and timestamp in JSON format.
- `/` or `/home` - **Home Page**: Renders the homepage with links to explore the site.
- `/about` - **About Page**: A simple "About" page with project information.

## Project Structure

This project follows a standard Symfony structure with the following key folders:

- `src/Controller`: Contains controllers that manage routes and responses.
- `templates/`: Stores Twig templates for rendering HTML pages.
- `config/`: Contains configuration files, including routes and services.
- `public/`: The document root for the server, where the front controller (`index.php`) is located.
